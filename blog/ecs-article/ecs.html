    <div class="article-text">
        <p>
            Hello to whoever is reading this, 
                I am writing this as sort of a way to remind me of the steps I took
                to get this setup to work. If you happen to stumble upon this post looking for a sample setup,
                I hope it will help you out.
        </p>

        <p> Terraform is a way to put up infrastructure using code. 
            The reason it's gaining popularity is that it can do it all in 1 command! 
            More info on that <a href="https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now as you can see from the title, this post is about putting up the ECS service on AWS. 
            I won't dwell too much on what the service is. You can read up about that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p> 
            The first part of this setup would be to put up a vpc (not in this post) and a load balancer.
            The load balancer would be the one receiving traffic from the internet and sending it to wherever we direct it to. 
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/henrygonzaless/527ab31b128bf0b393ffd8a3cd34ba3e.js"></script>

        <p> 
            The snippet above shows a simple load balancer being created. The value for the subnets will reference
            the public subnets declared in either your private vpc or default vpc in your region. The security group id will
            come from the a security group about to be declared.
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/henrygonzaless/0e17cbe7bdc4baa509dd2630805585f1.js"></script>

        <p>
            The security group for the load balancer references a vpc id. This is so that the subnets being referenced in the
            load balancer can be matched to the vpc you have provided in this security group.
        </p>

        <p> Next are the ingress settings. Ingress is the range of ports it listens on. For this load balancer,
            we will open up ports 443 and 80 for our HTTP/S traffic. The egress settings are set to -1 and port range 0 as
            we open it up to everything inside the vpc.
        </p>
