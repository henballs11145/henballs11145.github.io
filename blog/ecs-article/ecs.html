        <p>
            Hello to whoever is reading this, 
                I am writing this as sort of a way to remind me of the steps I took
                to get this setup to work. If you happen to stumble upon this post looking for a sample setup,
                I hope it will help you out.
        </p>

        <p> Terraform is a way to put up infrastructure using code. 
            The reason it's gaining popularity is that it can do it all in 1 command! 
            More info on that <a href="https://www.terraform.io/intro/index.html"><u>here</u></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now as you can see from the title, this post is about putting up the ECS service on AWS. 
            I won't dwell too much on what the service is. You can read up about that <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/"><u>here</u></a>.
        </p>

        <p> 
            The first part of this setup would be to put up a vpc (not in this post) and a load balancer.
            The load balancer would be the one receiving traffic from the internet and sending it to wherever we direct it to. 
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/henrygonzaless/527ab31b128bf0b393ffd8a3cd34ba3e.js"></script>

        <p> 
            The snippet above shows a simple load balancer being created. The value for the subnets will reference
            the public subnets declared in either your private vpc or default vpc in your region. The security group id will
            come from the a security group about to be declared.
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/henrygonzaless/0e17cbe7bdc4baa509dd2630805585f1.js"></script>

        <p>
            The security group for the load balancer references a vpc id. This is so that the subnets being referenced in the
            load balancer can be matched to the vpc you have provided in this security group.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next are the ingress settings. Ingress is the range of ports it listens on. For this load balancer,
            we will open up ports 443 and 80 for our HTTP/S traffic. The egress settings are set to -1 and port range 0 as
            we open it up to everything inside the vpc.
        </p>

        <p>
            Up next, we would need configurations for the listener. The listener is where the load balancer would listen for incoming traffic.
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/henrygonzaless/305c4dea98e5ebe94e27dae7036da291.js"></script>

        <p>
            The listener here would listen for http traffic at port 80. When it receives traffic from the load balancer, it forwards the traffic towards
            the target group being referenced in the default_action section. Configurations for a listener for https traffic is very much possible. One would
            need to register a certificate in the cert manager first and then add that in the configurations for the listener. More on that <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/lb_listener.html#forward-action"><u>here</u> </a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The target group that will receive the traffic from the listener can be seen right here.
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/henrygonzaless/fccf95302496909411957d9953722b4a.js"></script>

        <p> 
            A few notable configurations in the target group. The target_type I set is "ip". This is specific to the fargate launch type in 
            ECS. There are other values like lambda and the instance type depending on the configuration of what your setup will look like. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Next up would be the port. The port here would refer to the port where your docker image is exposed to.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally we have the health check configurations. I initially put this up with the default settings of the healthchecks only to find out that
            they were failing due to not having enough time to start up. So I bumped up the timeout and interval to 30s and 41s respectively. For the health checks to pass,
            the path and the status code have to match. In my case, I have the path to the home "/" path and the status code range of 200-301 in preparation for the https 301
            redirect listener. 
        </p>
